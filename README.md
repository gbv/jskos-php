**jskos** is a PHP library for easy processing of knowledge organization systems (KOS) as classifications, thesauri, and authority files given in [JSKOS data format](http://gbv.github.io/jskos/). JSKOS is a JSON format based on [Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference).

# Requirements

JSKOS-PHP requires PHP 7.0 or PHP 7.1. No additional libraries are required.

# Installation

## With composer

Install the latest version with

~~~bash
composer require gbv/jskos
~~~

This will automatically create `composer.json` for your project (unless it already exists) and add jskos as dependency. Composer also generates `vendor/autoload.php` to get autoloading of all dependencies: 

~~~php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$concept = new JSKOS\Concept( [ "uri" => "http://example.org" ] );
echo $concept->json();
~~~

# Usage and examples

The [jskos-php-examples repository](https://github.com/gbv/jskos-php-examples)
contains several examples, including wrappers of existing terminology services
(Wikidata, GND...) to JSKOS-API.

The examples can be tried online at <https://jskos-php-examples.herokuapp.com>.
