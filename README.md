**jskos** is a PHP library for easy processing of knowledge organization systems (KOS) as classifications, thesauri, and authority files given in [JSKOS data format](http://gbv.github.io/jskos/). JSKOS is a JSON format based on [Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference).

# Requirements

JSKOS-PHP works with PHP 5.6 or above. No additional libraries are required.

# Installation

## With composer

Install the latest version with

~~~bash
composer require gbv/jskos
~~~

This will automatically create `composer.json` for your project (unless it already exists) and add jskos as dependency. Composer also generates `vendor/autoload.php` to get autoloading of all dependencies: 

~~~php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'

$concept = new JSKOS\Concept( [ "uri" => "http://example.org" ] );
echo $concept->json();
~~~

## Manually with autoloading

Download the jskos library directory `src` and put it in a directory of your choice. Then enable autoloading for its classes by pointing to this directory: 

~~~php
spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
    static $JSKOS = '../src/'; # location relative to this file
    $class = explode('\\',$class);
    if ($class[0] == 'JSKOS') {
        require_once __DIR__."/$JSKOS$class[1].php";
    }
});

$concept = new JSKOS\Concept( [ "uri" => "http://example.org" ] );
echo $concept->json();
~~~

## Manually without autoloading

Download the jskos library directory `src` and put it in a directory of your choice. Then include file `JSKOS.php` which includes all library files:

~~~php
require_once 'src/JSKOS.php';

$concept = new JSKOS\Concept( [ "uri" => "http://example.org" ] );
echo $concept->json();
~~~
